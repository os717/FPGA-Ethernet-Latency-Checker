# FPGA-Ethernet-Latency-Checker

FPGA based latency measuring tool for Ethernet networks.

The architecture consists of two designs: a packet generator and a packet
re-transmitter. The packet generator sends timestamped packets through an
Ethernet interface. The packet re-transmitter detects the packets generated by
the generator and transmit them back, which are the used by the generator to
calculate the latency.

A serial interface on the packet generator can be used to extract the
measurements.

# Generating Vivado projects

The folder `scripts` contains TCL scripts for generating Vivado generate a
Vivado project for each of the designs. Use the following command to generate
the projects

```
vivado -mode batch -source scripts/generate_<design>.tcl
```
